Package: thrift-compiler
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Compiler for Thrift definition files
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
 development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
 build services that work efficiently and seamlessly.
 .
 This package contains the Thrift compiler that is used for translating
 from .thrift files (containing the definitions) to the language binding
 for the supported languages.

Package: python-thrift
Architecture: any
Section: python
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: python-twisted-core
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: Python bindings for Thrift
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
 development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
 build services that work efficiently and seamlessly.
 .
 This package contains the Python bindings for Thrift. You will need the thrift
 tool (in the thrift-compiler package) to compile your definition to Python
 classes, and then the modules in this package will allow you to use those
 classes in your programs.

Package: python-thrift-dbg
Architecture: any
Section: python
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, python-thrift (= ${binary:Version}), python-all-dbg
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: Python bindings for Thrift (debug version)
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
 development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
 build services that work efficiently and seamlessly.
 .
 This package contains the Python bindings for Thrift with debugging symbols.
 You will need the thrift tool (in the thrift-compiler package) to compile your
 definition to Python classes, and then the modules in this package will allow
 you to use those classes in your programs.

Package: libthrift-cil
Architecture: all
Section: libs
Depends: cli-common, libmono-corlib1.0-cil (>= 1.0), libmono-system1.0-cil (>= 1.0),

Description: CLI bindings for Thrift
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
 development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
 build services that work efficiently and seamlessly.
 .
 This package contains the CLI bindings for Thrift. You will need the thrift
 tool (in the thrift-compiler package) to compile your definition to C#
 classes, and then the modules in this package will allow you to use those
 classes in your programs.

Package: libthrift0
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Thrift C++ library
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
 development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
 build services that work efficiently and seamlessly.
 .
 This package contains the runtime libraries needed for C++ applications
 using Thrift.

Package: libthrift-dev
Architecture: any
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libthrift0, libglib2.0-dev
Description: Thrift C++ library (development headers)
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
 development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
 build services that work efficiently and seamlessly.
 .
 This package contains the development libraries required for writing C++
 applications using Thrift.
